        This site was created in order to help people. 
        <br>
        Buying tickets is always difficult because some people buy all the tickets 
        available and sell them at a higher price.<br>
        If you want to participate in your favorite concert and you don't want to 
        spend too much oney, buy tickets from this site and you will not regret it!
        <br>
        The only rule:<br>
        in order to prevent the purchase of numerous tickets, our site allows you to
        <br>- buy a maximum of two tickets
